\opening{Dear Dr. Sobhani}

We are a group of senior electrical and computer engineering majors currently in our senior design class at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Our group name is Jurassic Spark, and we would like to reach out to you with the utmost enthusiasm about the possibility of working on your exciting project! We find many aspects of developing and prototyping a shield and testing common off the shelf parts for durability against radiation incorporates unique challenges that excite us, and will help us to.

Our team believes that we are the most suited to meet the deliverables required for your project in an effective and efficient manner due to our variety in backgrounds and skills. We collectively have experience in PCB/circuit design, real-time embedded systems, FPGA design, Linux development, RF engineering, and networking. We also between ourselves have been a part of 10+ internships/research teams, in which we contributed as a part of an interdisciplinary group. If you are curious about the scope and some technical details about these experiences, attached in the email along with this letter should be a list of each group member with their respective skills and experience. 

By choosing us for this project, you are not only giving us the opportunity to demonstrate our expertise and contribute to helping educate fellow students with similar interests to our own, but would be giving us an exciting set of challenges that we can't wait to tackle together. We would greatly appreciate the ability to be a part of your team, and we are excited at the prospect of contributing to you and the Colorado Space Grant Consortium in your efforts to develop and distribute cost effective kits for the education of our peers. 

If you are interested in our group, you may reach out to our point of contact (Logan Caskey) for questions about us and a discussion on being a part of your project. Logan can be reached at the same email this is sent from (\href{mailto:logan.caskey@colorado.edu}{logan.caskey@colorado.edu}), or at his phone (\href{tel:+13035211772}{(303) 521-1772}), and he looks forward to hearing from you!
